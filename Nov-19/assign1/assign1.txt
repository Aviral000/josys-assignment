ContextAPI in Class Component:

1. Creation of the context:
  a. Same as Functional Component, it also require the createContext() method from the react module.
  b. Most important thing is that, we need to create a interface for the createContext, so that if I want to access value/property, only those properties will be accessible which are passed via interface.
  c. At the last, export the context.

2. Create a Provider Function:
  a. We are going to create a Functional Component, because once we create a context, it additionally provide me with a method called Provider.
  b. Now first, I need to import the variable via which I create the context and pass the interface.
  c. Secondly, in the provider function I will take children as a parameter to pass all the child component where I want to pass the data.
  d. With the method like Provider from createContext, I can pass the value attribute/property and inside it, I can pass the object of data.
  e. At the last, export the Provider Function.

3. Utilize the consumer function:
  a. In Class Based Component, their is nothing called hooks, we can't Utilize the useContext to access those value which is passed in Provider.
  b. For that, their is a different method in class based component which is known as Context Consumer.
  c. Firstly, we need to wrap the children component inside the Provider function in App file or Index File.
  d. In which child I want to access those value/properties, i just need to import the create context variable from create context file which firstly created.
  e. Then lastly, I need to wrap the child component code inside a tag of create context using the method consumer. Now I can able to access the properties which I pass via the Provider.
