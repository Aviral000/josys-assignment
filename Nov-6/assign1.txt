The map() method in JavaScript is a really handy way to loop through an array and create a new array based on each element.
Think of it like saying, 'For every item in this list, apply a certain operation and give me back a new list with those results.'

Example:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled);

output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
