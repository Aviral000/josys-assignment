The spread operator is like a shortcut that allows us to easily work with arrays, objects, and even function arguments.

Such as:

1. In terms of Merging arrays or objects:
    
    const arr1 = [1, 2];
    const arr2 = [3, 4];
    const mergedArr = [...arr1, ...arr2];
    console.log(copyArr);

2. In terms of Copying arrays or objects:

    const arr = [1, 2, 3];
    const copyArr = [...arr];
    console.log(copyArr);
