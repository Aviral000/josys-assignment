Unit Testing in Software Development

What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing is a software testing method where individual components or "units" of code are tested in isolation to verify they work as intended. A unit is typically a function, method, or class.

Why Write Unit Tests?
1. Early Bug Detection
   - Catch issues early in development
   - Reduce debugging time and costs
   - Prevent bugs from reaching production

2. Code Quality
   - Forces better code organization
   - Improves code maintainability
   - Acts as documentation for developers

3. Confidence in Changes
   - Safely refactor code
   - Verify new features don't break existing functionality
   - Enable continuous integration

Who Writes Unit Tests?
- Developers: Primary responsibility lies with the developer writing the code
- Test Engineers: May help establish testing patterns and frameworks
- QA Team: May review and supplement unit tests
- Team Lead: Often sets testing standards and coverage requirements

Popular JavaScript Testing Libraries

Jest
describe('Calculator', () => {
  test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
});

Mocha with Chai
// Example Mocha/Chai test
describe('Calculator', () => {
  it('should add two numbers correctly', () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).to.equal(3);
  });
});

Best Practices
1. Follow AAA Pattern
   - Arrange: Set up test data
   - Act: Execute the code being tested
   - Assert: Verify the results

2. Keep Tests
   - Simple
   - Independent
   - Readable
   - Fast

Code Coverage
- Aim for 70-80% coverage
- Focus on critical business logic
- Don't chase 100% blindly
